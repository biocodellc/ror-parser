# ROR JSON Parser
Script for parsing the ROR JSON data by country.

## Script 
- `script.py` is the parser. Creates JSON files sorted by country, only includes institution names and types.
**This repo does not include `ror.json` file. Requires `ror.json` in order to run.**

## Data
All JSON files in `data/` are output from the script. File names are organized by country code.

## ROR API
